<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at East China Normal University (ECNU), advised by Prof. Xiangfeng Wang. Before that, I worked at Huawei for three years, where I developed expertise in cloud-native technologies and distributed systems.

My current interests lie in **Multi-Agent (LLM-based)** systems and **AI Infrastructure**, including:
- Training, deployment, and optimization of large language models and agent systems  
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning and coordination in complex environments
- Systems and infrastructure support for AI workloads (clusters, networks, virtualization)

I aim to develop agentic systems that are robust, efficient, and practical in real-world applications.  

Outside of research, I enjoy strength training, playing guitar, appreciating whiskey and exploring cooking.
